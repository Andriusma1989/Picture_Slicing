# Image manipulation using Numpy
This project demonstrates how to use the NumPy library for imgage manipulation (slicing, rotating, merging)
## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have a Google account to access the Colab platform. Once you have access, you can open the picture_slicing.ipynb notebook file in Colab and execute the code cells.
